## Running these solutions

To run all days:
```
odin run .
```

To run only a specific day:
```
odin run . -- <day>
```

To run the provided tests for a specific day:
```
odin test . -- <day>
```

Note: individually specified days will run with verbose output, but running all days will only print the answers.
